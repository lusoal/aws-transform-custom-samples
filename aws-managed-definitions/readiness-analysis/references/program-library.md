# AWS Program & GTM Library

> **Purpose:** This reference is loaded by the Portfolio Agentic Readiness (portfolio-ara) and Portfolio Modernization Readiness (portfolio-mod) Task Definitions during their program-recommendation step. The analysis agent uses it to recommend relevant AWS programs and GTM motions in the "Next Steps / Recommended Programs" section of the generated portfolio report, based on the actual findings already produced.
>
> **Scope:** Program recommendations are an engagement-level decision and are produced ONLY by the two portfolio TDs — never by the per-repo ARA or MOD TDs. The portfolio view has the cross-repo and customer-segment context required to qualify these programs.
>
> **Source:** APN Programs Roadmap (Apr 2026) + AWS Highspot (Jun 2026). Compiled by Kevin Shin, 2026-06-15. Programs indexed: 42 — Tier 1 detailed: 34 (31 from the source library + 3 ARA agentic anchor programs); Tier 2 compact index: 8.

## How the Agent Uses This File

After the portfolio analysis has produced its findings (cross-cutting BLOCKERs/RISKs and readiness profiles for ARA; aggregated pathways, severity counts, and classification tiers for MOD), evaluate which programs are relevant and emit a short recommendation list. Follow these rules exactly:

1. **Recommend only when qualification criteria are met.** Each program lists signal patterns, "DO NOT recommend when" exclusions, and qualification criteria. A program is eligible only when its signal patterns match the findings AND none of its exclusions apply.
2. **Cap at 3–5 recommendations per report.** Never exceed 5. Fewer is better than overwhelming the customer.
3. **Prioritize in this order:**
   1. Direct finding match (the strongest signal pattern matches an actual finding)
   2. Customer segment fit (Enterprise / SMB / ISV / Startup / WWPS — inferred from portfolio `context` and `service_inventory`)
   3. Entry-point programs (no prerequisites) before follow-on programs (with prerequisites)
4. **Group recommendations under two headings, in this order:** `Funded Programs` → `Engagement Models`. Assessments, credits, tools, and self-service resources map under Funded Programs; hands-on engagements, workshops, and training map under Engagement Models.
5. **Never recommend programs marked `Retiring`** and never recommend programs marked `Launching` unless the launch is imminent (see Status Key below).
6. **Sequence logically:** Assessment → Funding → Execution → Optimization. Do not recommend a follow-on program without surfacing its prerequisite.
7. **Do not expose internal scoring.** The MOD internal 1–4 maturity score is internal only. When citing MOD evidence in a recommendation, reference unified severity (`High` / `Medium` / `Low`), `severity_status` (`Ready` / `Needs Work` / `Critical`), `score_rating` (`Mature` / `Partial` / `Needs Work` / `Not Ready`), or pathway/profile names — never the numeric score.
8. **Assessment overlap rule:** Recommend only ONE assessment per domain. For database findings, pick ONE of: DBC (speed, days), DBOLA (licensing depth, weeks), RDS Cost Assessment (rehost-only TCO), or OLA for Databases (general infra). Never stack multiple assessments for the same problem.
9. **EBA vs AML rule:** EBA = "learn by doing on real production workloads" (execution-focused, for stalled deals). AML = "structured training program with guided labs" (learning-focused, for skill building). Pick one, not both.
10. **Self-service alternative:** If the customer may not have a dedicated AWS account team (SMB, startup), always include at least one self-service option (Transform tools, Migration Evaluator, Skill Builder, workshop catalog).
11. **Run the reasoning checklist** (at the end of this file) before finalizing the list.

### Status Key

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Active` | Generally available, recommend freely |
| `Launching` | Announced but not yet GA; recommend only if launch ≤30 days away |
| `Retiring` | Being phased out; NEVER recommend |
| `Pilot` | Limited availability; note region/segment restrictions |

### Mapping findings to triggers — vocabulary alignment

This library is consumed by two different analyses with different finding vocabularies. When a signal pattern below references a "finding" or "dimension," interpret it against the actual emitted vocabulary:

**ARA (portfolio-agentic-readiness):**
- ARA emits findings with unified severity `High` / `Medium` / `Low` and native severity `BLOCKER` / `RISK-SAFETY` / `RISK-QUALITY` / `INFO`.
- ARA readiness profiles are exactly: `Agent-Ready`, `Pilot-Ready`, `Pilot-Ready (Safety Concerns)`, `Remediation Required`, `Not Agent-Integrable`.
- ARA category (dimension) display names are exactly: `API Surface`, `Authentication & Authorization`, `State Management`, `Human-in-the-Loop`, `Data Accessibility`, `Discovery & Documentation`, `Observability`, `Engineering Maturity`.
- "3+ High-severity findings across any dimension" → count unified `High` findings (BLOCKERs + conditional BLOCKERs resolved as High) across the portfolio / a service.
- A dimension "showing problems" → that category has 2+ `Medium`/`High` findings. ARA has no "Blocked"/"Needs Work" labels (those are MOD-only); translate accordingly.

**MOD (portfolio-modernization-readiness):**
- MOD emits findings with unified severity `High` / `Medium` / `Low`; per-category `severity_status` is `Ready` / `Needs Work` / `Critical`; `score_rating` is `Mature` / `Partial` / `Needs Work` / `Not Ready`.
- MOD pathway names are exactly: `Move to Cloud Native`, `Move to Containers`, `Move to Open Source`, `Move to Managed Databases`, `Move to Managed Analytics`, `Move to Modern DevOps`, `Move to AI`.
- MOD finding `effort` field is `High` / `Medium` / `Low` — use it for "High Effort" signal patterns.
- **On-prem / VMware / data-center triggers:** MOD analyzes workloads already targeting AWS and explicitly excludes on-prem from scope. Programs whose signal is "on-prem workloads" (OLA, Migration Evaluator, VMCCO, MAP) must trigger from portfolio/service `context` references (e.g., "running on EC2 from a legacy data center", "VMware estate", "migrating from on-prem") or from IaC evidence of non-AWS/VMware providers (`vsphere_*`, bare-metal configs) — NOT from MOD findings about workloads that already run on AWS.

`[ARA]`, `[MOD]`, or `[ARA+MOD]` tags on each program indicate which analysis the program is most relevant to. A program may be surfaced by either portfolio TD when tagged for both. Programs tagged `[ARA-anchor]` are agentic enablement programs surfaced only by the portfolio ARA TD.

---

## AGENTIC ENABLEMENT PROGRAMS (ARA Anchors)

> These three programs are surfaced **only by the portfolio ARA TD**. They are agentic-readiness-specific and have no MOD equivalent. They group under **Engagement Models** in the rendered output. When multiple are triggered, sequence them: AI DLC → AXE → Innovation EBA (Innovation EBA may run in parallel with AXE when use cases are independent).

### AI DLC (AI Driven Development Lifecycle) `[ARA-anchor]` `Active`
- **Signal patterns:** Portfolio shows teams without established AI-assisted development practices, or engineering-maturity findings indicate manual development workflows that could benefit from AI-driven automation. ARA shows `Pilot-Ready` or `Agent-Ready`; customer wants a structured methodology for AI-powered software development; MOD `Move to AI` pathway detected; customer has development teams ready to adopt AI-augmented workflows.
- **DO NOT recommend when:** Customer needs modernization before they can build with AI (recommend MAP/AppMod first); customer has no development team; findings show architecture is not ready for AI integration.
- **How to evaluate:** Check `Engineering Maturity` (ENG) findings across the portfolio. If 50%+ of services have a `Medium`+ finding on ENG-Q1 (Infra Governance), ENG-Q2 (CI/CD + Contracts), or ENG-Q3 (Rollback), recommend AI DLC. Also recommend if the portfolio `context` mentions a desire for AI-assisted development practices, or if architecture is at/near `Pilot-Ready`/`Agent-Ready`.
- **What the customer gets:** A structured methodology where AI handles planning, task decomposition, and code generation while developers retain control of validation and decisions. Delivers 2–5x development velocity gains. Includes hands-on engagement with AWS experts to implement the methodology across the development lifecycle.
- **How to engage:** Talk to your AWS account team about AI-DLC. Based on your agentic readiness classification, your architecture is positioned to adopt AI-driven development practices.
- **Time to value:** Weeks (methodology adoption); ongoing velocity gains.
- **Segment:** All.
- **Sequencing:** Run first — establishes AI-driven development practices before agentic work.
- **Prerequisite:** Architecture at or near `Pilot-Ready` / `Agent-Ready` per ARA findings.
- **Pairs with:** AXE, Innovation EBA, Agentic Catalyst Program.

### AXE (Agent Experience Engagement) `[ARA-anchor]` `Active`
- **Signal patterns:** Portfolio shows 3+ services in `Pilot-Ready` or `Agent-Ready` state, or business has defined customer/employee experience goals but lacks a technical implementation roadmap.
- **DO NOT recommend when:** Customer has fewer than 3 services at `Pilot-Ready`+; customer needs modernization before AI (recommend MAP/AppMod); customer already has an agentic implementation plan.
- **How to evaluate:** Count services with profile `Agent-Ready` or `Pilot-Ready`. If count >= 3, recommend AXE. Also recommend if the portfolio `context` describes experience-level goals (e.g., "customer support agent", "employee productivity") without a corresponding technical implementation plan.
- **What the customer gets:** A strategic methodology built on the proven D2E methodology (580+ successful engagements) delivering a six-phase framework: business process mapping, task identification, evaluation metrics, data architecture, governance, and guardrails. The Guardrails & Boundaries phase aligns with ARA — together they provide a complete assess-to-implement pathway: ARA validates system readiness while AXE designs the agent experience and implementation roadmap.
- **How to engage:** Talk to your AWS account team about AXE. Given your portfolio's agentic readiness, this engagement designs the agent experience and implementation roadmap.
- **Segment:** Enterprise.
- **Sequencing:** Run after AI DLC to design the agent experience.
- **Pairs with:** AI DLC, Innovation EBA, ACP.

### Innovation EBA (AIML-GenAI) `[ARA-anchor]` `Active`
- **Signal patterns:** Portfolio `context` indicates AI/ML or GenAI is a strategic imperative, executive sponsorship exists, use cases deliver critical business value, a data strategy exists, and the customer is committed to production deployment within ~90 days. The portfolio should also show a backlog of AIML-GenAI use cases and a customer team committed to upskilling.
- **DO NOT recommend when:** Customer has no executive sponsorship; no data strategy; no GenAI use cases identified; customer needs modernization before AI.
- **How to evaluate:** Check portfolio `context` for: (1) AI/ML or GenAI as strategic priority, (2) executive sponsorship, (3) existing data and data strategy (services with established data pipelines, DynamoDB/Aurora/S3 data stores), (4) use cases in customer experience (chatbots, post-call analytics, personalization), productivity (intelligent search, summarization, code generation), business operations (IDP, fraud detection, predictive maintenance), or content creation. Also recommend if 3+ services have production-ready data stores AND the `context` describes GenAI ambitions beyond what AXE alone covers.
- **What the customer gets:** A 3-day sprint-based, interactive engagement following the 4-step EBA framework (Executive Alignment → Readiness → Accelerate → Transform At Scale) with workstreams including Foundations, Data Engineering, GenAI Build/Evaluate, UI Integration, ML Ops, and Command Center. Develops skills through learning-by-doing and builds/accelerates a GenAI use case pipeline.
- **How to engage:** Talk to your AWS account team about Innovation EBA. Your portfolio shows strong data foundations and GenAI ambitions — this engagement accelerates a use case into production.
- **Segment:** Enterprise (higher cloud maturity).
- **Sequencing:** Run when the customer is ready to accelerate a use case into production; may run in parallel with AXE if use cases are independent.
- **Pairs with:** AI DLC, AXE, GenAI Innovation Center.

- **Self-paced links:** [SQL Server](https://catalog.workshops.aws/mma-mssql-pg/en-US) | [Oracle](https://catalog.workshops.aws/mma-oracle-pg/en-US) | [Sybase](https://catalog.workshops.aws/mma-sybase-pg)
- **Pairs with:** DBC, DBOLA, AWS Transform for SQL Server, EBA, MAP.

### SHIP (Security Health Improvement Program) `[ARA+MOD]` `Active`
- **Signal patterns:** ARA findings reference hardcoded credentials, missing secrets management, no CloudTrail/audit trail, unmonitored network exposure, missing encryption, or lack of vulnerability scanning. Also relevant when MOD identifies modernization pathways and the target AWS environment lacks foundational security services.
- **DO NOT recommend when:** ARA Auth findings are purely application-layer agent readiness gaps (machine identity for agents, scoped agent permissions, agent identity suspension, on-behalf-of flows). These require application code changes, not AWS service enablement. Also skip if customer already has GuardDuty, Security Hub, Config, and IAM Access Analyzer active.
- **Important distinction:** SHIP = infrastructure-layer security (are the right AWS security services enabled and operationalized?). ARA Auth dimension = application-layer agent readiness (can your app safely interact with autonomous agents?). Different layers. Don't conflate them.
- **What the customer gets:** Free security posture assessment covering 9 foundational use cases (threat detection, CSPM, vulnerability management, configuration monitoring, application firewall, application security testing, credentials protection, network protection, key management). Establishes a baseline, delivers a prioritized improvement roadmap, and routes to deeper engagements as needed. Repeatable unlimited times.
- **How to engage:** Talk to your AWS account team about the Security Health Improvement Program. Based on the security infrastructure findings in this report, SHIP maps your gaps to specific AWS services and provides a prioritized remediation roadmap at no cost.
- **Time to value:** 2 weeks (Discovery Call → Delivery Meeting → Actionable Roadmap).
- **Prerequisite:** None. Any customer, any size, any support tier.
- **Directly resolves these findings:**
  - "Hardcoded credentials / no secrets management" → Credentials Protection (Secrets Manager)
  - "No audit logging / no CloudTrail" → Configuration Monitoring + Threat Detection
  - "Missing encryption / no key management" → Key Management (KMS)
  - "Unmonitored network exposure" → Network Protection + Vulnerability Management
- **Does NOT resolve these ARA findings (recommend EBA or ProServe instead):**
  - "No machine identity authentication for agents"
  - "No scoped permissions per agent"
  - "No agent identity suspension mechanism"
  - "No action-level authorization"
- **Inline remediation note:** For simple findings like "missing encryption at rest", the report should first recommend the direct fix (e.g., enable KMS encryption on the resource) in the remediation section. SHIP is recommended when there are **multiple** infrastructure security gaps that suggest a systemic posture problem, not for isolated single-service fixes.
- **Pairs with:** Well-Architected Review, MAP (if remediation needs funding), Immersion Days (go deeper on specific services).

## AGENT REASONING CHECKLIST

Before finalizing the recommendation list, verify each item:

1. ☐ Does every recommended program meet its qualification criteria based on actual findings?
2. ☐ Have I checked the "DO NOT recommend when" exclusions for each selected program?
3. ☐ Is the total count between 3 and 5 recommendations?
4. ☐ Are recommendations grouped correctly? (`Funded Programs` → `Engagement Models`)
5. ☐ Did I check workload-specific programs (VMware, Windows, Oracle, SAP, Kafka, Mainframe)?
6. ☐ Did I check customer segment (Startup → Activate/IW; ISV → ACP/Booster/SaaS Factory; SMB → self-service options)?
7. ☐ Did I include at least one entry-point program (no prerequisites)?
8. ☐ Are programs sequenced logically? (Assessment → Funding → Execution → Optimization; for ARA anchors: AI DLC → AXE → Innovation EBA)
9. ☐ Did I apply the assessment overlap rule (only ONE assessment per domain)?
10. ☐ Did I apply the EBA vs AML rule (pick one, not both)?
11. ☐ Am I using the correct vocabulary? (ARA: unified severity + profile names; MOD: severity_status + score_rating + pathway names; NEVER internal 1–4 scores)
12. ☐ Is no `Retiring` program included? Is no `Launching` program included unless launch ≤30 days away?
13. ☐ For SMB/startup customers, did I include at least one self-service option?
14. ☐ Is "How to engage" framed from the customer's perspective?
